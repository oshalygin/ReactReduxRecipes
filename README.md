1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run  `npm install`  to pull in the project dependencies.
3.  Run  `npm start`  to kick off the application.
    * It should automatically load a browser window and point to  `http://localhost:9999`.
    * If the browser window does not load, then manually navigate your browser to  `http://localhost:9999`.
3.  If you are on a Windows environment, run `npm run start-windows`.
    * babel-watch doesn't work on Windows as it uses unix named pipes.
4.  Run `npm test` to explicitly run the tests in the solution.
    * Note that they are ran upon application start regardless, but this is a quicker feedback loop.
